# retroforge DEV signing key — what lets a dev card take a new build as an update instead of a
# reflash, so its /home (Steam and its games, the x86 guest, emulators, Wi-Fi) survives.
#
#   ota/gen-dev-signing.sh                 # mints into work/dev-pki/, once (dev.env runs it)
#   DEV_PKIDIR=<dir> ota/gen-dev-signing.sh
#
# A device installs a bundle only if its signature chains to /etc/rauc/keyring.pem, and every image
# carries the project's CA there (ota/rauc/retroforge-ca.pem), whose key is not on a dev box. So a
# dev card ALSO trusts this build box's own dev CA: rootfs/lib-assemble-devcard.sh appends
# work/dev-pki/ca.cert.pem to its keyring, and a dev build's `make bundle` signs with
# work/dev-pki/release.{cert,key}.pem. Then, once a card is flashed with that keyring:
#
#   set -a; . ./dev.env; set +a; make bundle
#   scp out/images/retroforge-<build>.raucb root@<device>:/home/  &&  ssh root@<device> rauc install /home/retroforge-<build>.raucb
#
# The same two levels and the same signing-cert profile as the real PKI (ota/gen-signing-ca.sh,
# ota/rauc/release.ext), so rauc's check-purpose=codesign accepts it exactly as it does a release
# signature: a CA that signs nothing but the signing cert, and a CA:FALSE codeSigning leaf.
#
# Only dev cards trust it: the dev-card stage is never sourced for a release image, and
# rootfs/guard-rootfs.sh fails a release image whose keyring is anything but the project CA. A
# release device rejects these bundles, and ota/publish-bundle.sh refuses to publish one (it
# verifies against the project CA alone).
#
# Like the dev SSH key (dev.env, work/dev-ssh/), it is per build box, lives under work/ (gitignored,
# kept by `make distclean`), and is never regenerated over itself: cards flashed with this CA reject
# bundles signed by any other. Deleting work/dev-pki means reflashing those cards once more.
