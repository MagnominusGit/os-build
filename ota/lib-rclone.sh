# Sourced, never executed. Its own file so the credential setup and the fetch-and-verify live in one
# place; it served the card publisher too until cards became GitHub Release assets (2026-10-13).

# --- the R2 remote --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configured entirely through the environment so no credential is ever written to disk — the same
# instinct as .github/workflows/image.yml keeping the RAUC key in $RUNNER_TEMP: anything left in the
# workspace gets swept into artifacts and caches. The remote is named "r2"; paths are r2:<bucket>/...
# The three credentials use :? so EMPTY fails as loudly as unset, which is the case that actually
# happens: in CI they are always *set*, to whatever `${{ secrets.R2_* }}` evaluated to, and an
# environment-scoped secret evaluates to the EMPTY STRING in any job that does not declare that
# environment. No error, no warning, at the point of evaluation. The message names that case rather
# than making you rediscover it after a build.
R2_ENV_HINT='not set. In CI: check the secret exists (repo settings), and if it is scoped to an
  environment, that the job names that environment -- an environment-scoped secret reads as EMPTY,
  silently, in a job that does not.'
