#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Offline test for ota/gen-dev-signing.sh: the build box's dev OTA key, which lets a dev card take a
# new build as an update (rauc install) instead of a reflash that erases its /home.
#
#   tests/test-dev-signing.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every rule below fails as a dev card that refuses its next bundle, which is found
# only after a full build and a copy to the device: a CA regenerated over the one cards were flashed
# with; a signing cert rauc's check-purpose=codesign does not accept; private keys written into a
# tracked tree; a keyring of the project CA plus the dev CA that does not verify the dev signature.
# The guard's side (a release keyring is the project CA alone) is in rootfs/guard-rootfs.sh.
