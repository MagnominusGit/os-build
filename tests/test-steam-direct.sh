#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Offline test for /usr/bin/retroforge-steam-direct and /usr/bin/steam's "Without the client" block:
# Steam games started without the Steam client, on by default (first for the MANGMI Air X, 3.5 GB:
# Hades was killed in its first room with the client, and played without it, 2026-10-22).
#
#   tests/test-steam-direct.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Each rule below fails as a game that does not start, starts differently from how
# Steam starts it, or a Steam that never comes back:
#   the setting: on by default, on every board; saved
#     beside the other Steam settings (DXVK_SAREK, KEEP_RUNNING), which stay; an override for testing;
#   what is replayed: Steam's own newest logged launch of that game ("Game process added"), from
#     console_log.txt or console_log.previous.txt, kept in a cache so a rotated log does not lose it;
#     run as Steam ran it (/bin/sh -c, at oom_score_adj 900), word for word, from the launch entry's
#     working folder, with Steam's compat variables (the game's library on an SD card too) and the
#     launch's own environment;
#   when it is not: the setting off (silently), a client running other than the kept one in the
#     background (a stale steam.pid is not one), a game Steam never started here, not installed or
#     changing, an x86 game (Steam's FEX tool), a compat tool that is gone; each says why, and nothing
#     runs;
#   the wrapper: execs the helper for a game it can start, with the D-Bus check and DXVK-Sarek done
#     and none of the client's own set-up; with keep-running on, the kept client beside it, minimal:
#     started first (and signed in) when Steam has a remembered sign-in, without the game's URI; the
#     game starts anyway when it does not sign in in time; everything else (Steam's UI, a first launch,
#     the kept client's own run) starts the client as before.
# Steam's programs are stubs that record how they were called; the client's binary caches are written
# by a small encoder of Valve's binary KeyValues (as in test-steam-library.sh).
