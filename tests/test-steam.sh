# Offline test for /usr/bin/steam and /usr/lib/retroforge/steam-bootstrap: how the image provides the
# `steam` the OpenGamepadUI Steam plugin launches games with.
#
#   tests/test-steam.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Neither is exercised before a player picks a Steam game, and each rule below fails
# as a game that never starts, a black screen, a half-set-up client that looks ready, or a ~631 MB
# surprise download:
#   the pin (steam.pin): names CHANNELS, not versions; the client channel is a steamdeck_ line,
#     because the plugin starts the client with -steamdeck.
#   bootstrap, client:
#   - reads steam_client_<client_channel>_linuxarm64 and installs Valve's arm64 client binaries,
#     refusing them unless the manifest's sha256 matches;
#   - writes package/beta = the channel when it installs the client and when the file is missing,
#     and otherwise leaves it to the client;
#   - unpacks Valve's zips correctly: '\' separators, no execute bits in the zip, Unix symlinks;
#   - a failed download leaves no half-set-up client and no temp files, and never touches the
#     player's other files in the Steam folder;
#   - refuses a zip path or symlink that leaves its folder;
#   - downloads no Steam Runtime, and removes the one earlier builds installed.
#   wrapper:
#   - runs steamrtarm64/steam raw on the host (no runtime container: games' pressure-vessel cannot
#     start nested in it) with the plugin's arguments, from steamrtarm64 with its own libraries first
#     on LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and starts it again on exit 42 (after an update);
#   - points ~/.steam/steam and ~/.steam/root at the client, and the links Valve's steam.sh makes;
#   - drops a D-Bus address that is not ours, and the STEAM_RUNTIME variables;
#   - a failed bootstrap is exit 1 without running anything.
#   kept running in the background (retroforge-steam-keep, the wrapper's "Kept running" block): on
#   by default; the first launch starts the client as a user unit with the launch's environment
#   (OGUI_ID=Steam, not the game's), later ones hand their arguments to it, and a game's launch lasts
#   exactly as long as Steam's own reaper for that app id (never OGUI's reaper, which takes the same
#   arguments), so OGUI neither returns to its menu early nor waits forever. Exit from OGUI's menu ends
#   the game's processes, not Steam; a kept client turned off mid-game stops when the game ends;
#   without a user manager Steam runs with the launch, as when off.
#   minimal: the kept client's web helper is killed and the one the client starts again frozen, and
#   nothing it had started yet lives; frozen already, nothing is killed; a launch that needs Steam's
#   UI holds it running (Steam's UI until OGUI closes it, a game until it has run a while), a hold of a
#   launch that is gone does not.
# Valve's servers are replaced by file:// URLs: $CDN for the client.
