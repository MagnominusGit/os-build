# Every stage it runs is a stand-in here (the bootstrap, the x86 guest helper, /usr/bin/steam,
# install-steamcmd and the stub), so the suite checks steam-install's own job: the order of the
# stages, one forward-only percentage (stdout and the progress file the page reads), the exit
# statuses retroforge-emu's page understands, and what "installed" means. The stages themselves have
# their own suites (test-steam.sh, test-steam-x86-guest.sh, test-steamcmd-stub.sh).
