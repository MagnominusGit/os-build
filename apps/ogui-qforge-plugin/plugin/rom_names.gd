extends RefCounted

## Card names for ROMs, and which of the library's cards a rescan must drop. Plain functions with
## no OGUI types, so tests/test-plugin.sh can run them in a stock headless Godot.
##
## OGUI keys its whole library by item NAME, across every provider: a second launch item with a
## name the library already holds is merged into the first item, and if both come from the same
## library the second one is silently dropped. So every ROM needs a name no other ROM has.


## A name per ROM, in the same order. roms: [{"system": id, "path": file}], system_names: id ->
## label. A ROM keeps its file name (without extension) unless another ROM has the same one:
## then the system is added when the other ROM is from another system ("Tetris (PlayStation)"),
## and the extension when both are from the same system ("Tetris (CUE)"). Compared without case,
## as OGUI keeps per-game settings under the lower-cased name.
