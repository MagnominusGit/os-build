## The player's Steam games: every game the account owns, installed or not, from the Steam client
## they signed into (/usr/lib/retroforge/steam-library reads its caches), without the second sign-in
## the OGUI Steam plugin needs (steamcmd). An installed game launches as that plugin starts it,
## `steam ... -silent steam://rungameid/<appid>`: OGUI takes the Steam app id from that argument
## (LibraryLaunchItem.get_app_id), so gamescope focuses the game's window, and runs its Steam
## handling (RunningApp.is_steam_app).
##
## A game that is not installed gets OGUI's Install, and an installed one Uninstall: both are handed
## to Steam (steam://install/<appid>, steam://uninstall/<appid>), whose own dialog opens in Big
## Picture, started as Main menu > Apps > Steam Client starts it. The game's app manifest then
## says how the download goes (install_progressed) and when it is done. Steam downloads while it
## runs: leaving Steam before the end ends the install here as failed, and Steam carries on with it
## while it still runs, or at its next start.
