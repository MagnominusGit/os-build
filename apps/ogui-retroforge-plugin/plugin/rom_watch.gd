extends RefCounted

## Automatic ROM rescan: tells the plugin when ~/roms changed and the change has settled. No OGUI
## types, so tests/test-plugin.sh runs it in a stock headless Godot.
##
## OGUI only reloads its library at start and from Settings > Library > Refresh Library, so ROMs
## copied over SMB stayed invisible. The plugin polls instead (no inotify tools in the image, and
## OGUI has no IPC a systemd .path unit could poke): every poll lists each system folder with
## name, size and mtime. A directory mtime alone is not enough: Godot reports it in whole seconds,
## so a file created in the same second as the last poll went unseen, and an SMB copy can set the
## final size first and fill the file in afterwards (only its mtime moves while it copies).
##
## A rescan is due when the folders differ from what the library last loaded AND two polls in a
## row agree, so a copy in progress (a file still growing or still being written) waits for the
## copy to end, and a half-written .m3u is never read.
##
## Game FOLDERS (game_dirs.gd: PS3 disc dumps) count by their marker file: a folder copied over SMB
## shows up once the file that makes it a game is there and has stopped changing. The rest of the
## folder is not walked (thousands of files, every 5 s), so a game whose marker arrives before its
## other files may be listed while the copy still runs.
