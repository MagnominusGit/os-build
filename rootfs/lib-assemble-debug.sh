# SOURCED by rootfs/assemble-rootfs.sh, never executed. Split out of it for issue #43; the code
# and its rationale are unchanged (tests/test-mkroot.sh reads the `# STAGE <name>` banners out of
# this file set, and asserts the roster it was audited against).
#
# NEVER sourced unless RETROFORGE_DEBUG=1. Independent of RETROFORGE_DEV -- it applies to release builds too.
#
# Reads the assembler's globals rather than taking arguments -- $stage (the staged tree), $ROOT
# (repo root), $OUT (build outputs). Turning ~20 implicit globals into positional parameters is
# where a verbatim move stops being verbatim, so it is deliberately not done.

# STAGE debug-capture — journald log capture (RETROFORGE_DEBUG=1). INDEPENDENT of RETROFORGE_DEV, applies to release too.
# This device has no UART and is usually powered off abruptly, and journald's default
# SyncIntervalSec=5min means a short boot's system logs (kernel/NetworkManager/wpa_supplicant/
# regulatory) never reach disk before the power is cut — that is why a released card's persistent
# journal held only the late gamescope session and none of the Wi-Fi bring-up. Under DEBUG, force
# persistent storage, sync every few seconds so logs survive a power-yank, drop the rate limit so
# gamescope's chatter cannot evict other units, and cap size generously. Diagnostic builds only —
# never ship: the frequent fsync + unbounded logging beat on the SD card. See wifi diagnosis thread.

  # (b) The real capture: journald reliably RECEIVES system logs into its runtime journal but on
  # this RO-root device it does not persist them to /var before power is cut (a released card kept
  # only the late gamescope session). So stream the live journal to the ext4 /home partition, which
  # IS writable and survives a power-yank. `journalctl -b -f` first dumps the WHOLE boot backlog
  # (kernel/NM/wpa/regulatory, even though this unit starts at multi-user) then follows live — so it
  # captures the OOBE Wi-Fi connect attempt on the RELEASE path. Plus a one-shot regdom/dmesg snapshot.
