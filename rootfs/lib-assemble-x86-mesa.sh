# STAGE x86-mesa — /usr/lib/retroforge/x86-mesa/{root/,payload.conf}: our Mesa (Turnip, zink, the GL
# front ends, the VRAM layer) built for x86_64 and i686 by packages/mesa-x86 from packages/mesa's own
# pin and patches. It is the image's one x86 payload, and it runs nothing on the host: steam-x86-guest
# lays root/ over the x86 guest it downloads for Valve's FEX tool (fuse-overlayfs, read-only), so x86
# games under FEX use our driver instead of the guest's stock one. payload.conf names the Arch
# snapshot it was built against (steam-x86-guest skips a guest older than that) and the Mesa version.
#
# Built by `make mesa-x86` (a $(ROOTFS) prerequisite unless RETROFORGE_X86_MESA=0). Missing means a
# stale invocation bypassed make; fail rather than ship an image whose x86 games quietly fall back to
# the guest's Mesa.
