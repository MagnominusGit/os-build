# launch_formats — how retroforge-launch runs each kind of download (emulator.json's "format"):
# appimage and appimage-sharun are mounted for the run, scripts and binary run in place. Each is a
# class with prepare() (-> the root the definition's binary is relative to), env() and release()
# (never raises). The AppImage rules (never exec AppRun, the runtime's ignored SIGTERM, the sweep of
# a dead mount) are in retroforge-launch's header.
#
# The scripts format (PortMaster) is a folder retroforge-emu unpacked under $HOME, never mounted: --gui
# runs <root>/<binary> in place, and a game card's ROM is ITSELF a script -- a port's own launch
# script, which PortMaster installed beside its folder -- run with bash (args, "{rom}" = the
# script), never with exec: its mode is whatever the port's zip carried. Not installed (exit 3,
# `not-installed`) when <root>/<binary> is not executable, for a game too: every port script sources
# PortMaster's control files. When the run ends, every runtime a port left mounted is released: the
# mounts RetroForge's port `mount` stand-in (/usr/lib/retroforge/portmaster/bin/mount) records in
# $RETROFORGE_PM_MOUNTS (default $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/retroforge-portmaster-mounts), whose squashfuse daemons
# outlive the port's session when OGUI's Exit skips the port's own umount.
#
# The binary format (gopher64 shipped this way until RMG replaced it) is a download that is ONE
# plain executable: retroforge-emu names it
# <tag>.AppImage all the same (the name is only a name; nothing checks the file is an AppImage) and
# points `current` at it. It runs in place, nothing to mount: the definition's binary is `current`
# itself, relative to the emulator's folder.

      access Windows-1252 fonts", HW 2026-10-05).
    - Vulkan: sharun points the loader at the bundled drivers unless SHARUN_ALLOW_SYS_VKICD=1. Every
      emulator runs on the image's Turnip (Dolphin 2609 bundles an older Mesa).

    The self-updater hook never runs here (only AppRun sources hooks, and it also needs $APPIMAGE,
