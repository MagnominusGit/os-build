# Mount an inserted SD card for the session user (ROMs, saves) — the other half of the storage path.
#
# CALLED BY TWO THINGS AND FILTERS FOR NEITHER: block-event.sh (the udev entry point, which has
# already decided this event deserves a mount) and format-device.sh (which has just made the
# filesystem on purpose). Every "should this event be acted on" question — the lock, udevadm settle,
# was-the-media-just-inserted — lives in block-event.sh, so nothing here can misapply one to a
# caller it was not meant for. That separation is not stylistic: holding those checks in this file
# refused the formatter's own post-format mount and left the card unmounted, twice in one afternoon.
#
#   /usr/lib/retroforge/storage/automount.sh add|remove <partition kernel name>
#
# WHY THE OS HAS TO DO THIS AT ALL. The client enumerates drives over UDisks2 — it carries generated
# bindings for the whole API and a CUDisksDrive::ThreadedAdopt — and on this hardware it does notice
# a card: the status bar shows one. What it does NOT do is mount it. Measured 2026-09-02 on an
# internally-installed device: card in, udisksd answering, nothing under /run/media and nothing in
# Settings > Storage.
#
# IT MOUNTS THROUGH UDISKS2 RATHER THAN CALLING mount(8), and that is not ceremony. udisks owns the
# mountpoint namespace the client reads (/run/media/<user>/<label>), applies the filesystem-specific
# option whitelist, and — via as-user — makes the mount belong to the session user rather than to
# root. A hand-rolled mount lands somewhere the client is not looking, with the wrong owner.
#
# THE SESSION USER IS RESOLVED FROM uid 1000, not from `id -u player`. The name is ours to choose and
# the id is pinned in sysusers.d; a udev-triggered unit that dies because a name changed is a card
# that silently stops mounting.

# EXT4 ONLY — INHERITED, AND ITS REASON IS GONE. Upstream's stated reason was the Steam library:
# "We need symlinks for Steam for now, so only automount ext4 as that's what Steam will format".
# There is no Steam client here, and emulators read ROMs fine from exfat/vfat, which is what most
# people's ROM cards are. Widening this is an open decision (it also needs the matching udisks
# options and a test), not an oversight; until then a non-ext4 card is left unmounted.
#
# EXIT 0, where upstream exits 2. Inserting a card from another system is a normal thing for a
# person to do, not a fault, and this runs as a templated systemd unit — a non-zero exit leaves a
# failed unit sitting in `systemctl --failed` for the rest of the boot. That distinction cost this

# udisks answers on the system bus and is D-Bus activated, so this call is what starts it — ONCE
# THERE IS A BUS. The unit is ordered After=dbus.socket for that reason; see its header.
# as-user is what puts the mount under /run/media/$PLAYER_USER/ and gives the session ownership of it;
# auth.no_user_interaction because there is no one to ask — this runs from udev, with no session.
#
# STDERR IS KEPT, and that is not a detail. This used to fold stderr into the stdout pipe and then
# sed away everything that was not a mountpoint, so EVERY failure — no bus, no such object, a polkit
# refusal — arrived in the journal as the single line "udisks refused to mount", which named the
# wrong culprit for the one failure that actually happened: at cold boot with a card already in the
# slot, this ran ~8s before dbus-broker was ready and busctl never reached udisks at all
# (HW-caught 2026-09-03). A reason collected and discarded is worse than no reason.
# REPAIR BEFORE MOUNTING, and mount read-only if the repair could not finish. `fsck.ext4 -y` returns
# 0 when the filesystem was clean and 1 when it corrected errors; anything else means it could not
# be made consistent, and mounting such a card read-write is how a card with a damaged journal
# becomes a card with damaged games. Upstream also reported the failure to the Steam client
# (steam://system/devicemountresult); there is no client to tell here, so the read-only mount and
# the journal line are the whole answer.
