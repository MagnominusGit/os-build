# retroforge read-only root assembler — stage `rauc-boot-mirror`: RAUC keyring, boot mirror, installer GPT.
#
# SOURCED by rootfs/assemble-rootfs.sh, never executed. Split out of it for issue #43; the code
# and its rationale are unchanged (tests/test-mkroot.sh reads the `# STAGE <name>` banners out of
# this file set, and asserts the roster it was audited against).
#
# Runs at top level, in place: sourcing it IS the stage.
#
# Reads the assembler's globals rather than taking arguments -- $stage (the staged tree), $ROOT
# (repo root), $OUT (build outputs). Turning ~20 implicit globals into positional parameters is
# where a verbatim move stops being verbatim, so it is deliberately not done.

# STAGE rauc-boot-mirror — the device keyring and the slot's own boot software (Phase 4b pass 2).
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Two things the overlay tree cannot carry, because both are BUILD OUTPUTS rather than static files.
#
# 1. The keyring. /etc/rauc/system.conf points at /etc/rauc/keyring.pem; it is installed here from
#    the committed CA so there is ONE copy in the repo (ota/rauc/retroforge-ca.pem, which
#    ota/gen-signing-ca.sh also signs bundles against) rather than a duplicate under rootfs/overlay that could drift.
#
# 2. The boot software, mirrored under /usr/lib/retroforge/boot. The ESP GRUB that picks the slot
#    and both per-slot stage-2 configs are owned by the same build that ships /boot/vmlinuz.efi and
#    /lib/modules/<ver> inside this root, so carrying them here makes the pairing true by
#    construction: the RAUC post-install hook refreshes the ESP and the slot's efi partition FROM
#    this directory, so an update can never install a root whose boot chain does not boot it.
#
#    steamcl.efi IS THE ESP GRUB, as a symlink. A root from before the ESP GRUB installs the first
#    update into this one with ITS hook, which copies /usr/lib/retroforge/boot/steamcl.efi onto the
#    ESP as \EFI\BOOT\bootaa64.efi (with steamcl-version and fonts/default.pf2 beside it, and
#    grubaa64.efi + grub-<slot>.cfg + the boot font onto the slot's efi partition). Under those names
#    it installs this build's chain without knowing it, and the ESP GRUB then follows the boot conf
#    that hook re-armed (boot/gen-esp-cfg.sh). The hook reads through the link with cp and sha256sum.
#
#    /usr/bin/grub-editenv is RAUC's: bootloader=grub runs it for every slot-state call. It is built
#    with the GRUB above (boot/grub.sh); nothing in the package set ships one.

# The GPT, shipped VERBATIM beside the slot-write primitives (Phase 2 of
# .claude/plans/internal-install.plan.md). image/genpart.sh --append lays our eight partitions into
# an OEM disk's free space and reports where they landed; partition-table.txt is the single source
# of the sizes, types and GPT names it works from, and the same file image/make-sdcard.sh uses for
# a card.
#
# VERBATIM IS THE POINT, and guard-rootfs.sh diffs the two copies rather than trusting this line.
# An installer working from a stale table would produce a disk whose partition SIZES differ from the
# card the release was tested on, and the first symptom is a rootfs image that does not fit a slot --
# after the OEM's userdata has already been destroyed, which is not a state to discover a drift in.
# genpart.sh resolves the table next to itself for exactly this reason, so it needs no argument here
# and behaves identically from image/ in the repo and from /usr/lib/retroforge/install/ on a device.
